# üö¶ Urban Traffic Volume Prediction
*Predicting City Traffic using Machine Learning (Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset)*

## üìë Overview

This repository contains a step-by-step educational project for **predicting urban traffic volume** using the [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).  
The project is designed as a reference for both **practical machine learning workflows** and **educational purposes**, including advanced topics such as:
- Feature Engineering (especially from date-time features)
- Outlier Detection & Handling
- Regularization techniques
- Model building & evaluation (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Tree-based, XGBoost, etc.)
- Scientific documentation & reproducibility

> This repository can serve as a resource for colleagues, an ML teaching course, and even as the base for a book or advanced technical notes.

## Objectives

- How to perform practical machine learning on real-life tabular data
- Feature extraction from time-series and weather info
- Working with outliers, missing values, and categorical encodings
- Building, evaluating, and comparing regression models
- Understanding regularization for overfitting prevention

## üìö Educational Roadmap

The project is organized as **a series of Jupyter Notebooks** covering practical steps:
1. **Introduction & Data Loading**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Feature Engineering (Time, Weather, Holidays, etc.)**  
4. **Outlier Detection & Handling**  
5. **Data Preprocessing**  
6. **Baseline Modeling (Linear Regression, Regularization)**  
7. **Tree-based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)**  
8. **Model Evaluation, Visualization & Interpretation**  
9. **Summary & Further Explorations**  

Each notebook contains clear explanations (English, with Persian notes where needed), code, and visualizations suitable for learning and teaching.

## Dataset Description

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/492/metro+interstate+traffic+volume)
- **Description**: Hourly measurements of road traffic volume and weather conditions captured from 2012 to 2018 on Interstate 94 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The data enables regression modeling to predict traffic volume based on temporal, meteorological, and event/holiday features.  
- **Features:**
    - `holiday` ‚Äî Name of holiday for the record, or None if not a holiday (categorical)
    - `temp` ‚Äî Temperature in Kelvin (float)
    - `rain_1h` ‚Äî Rainfall in the previous hour (mm, float)
    - `snow_1h` ‚Äî Snowfall in the previous hour (mm, float)
    - `clouds_all` ‚Äî Cloud coverage (% from 0 to 100, integer)
    - `weather_main` ‚Äî Main weather category (Clear, Clouds, Rain, etc.)
    - `weather_description` ‚Äî Detailed weather description (string)
    - `date_time` ‚Äî Timestamp of data point (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
    - `traffic_volume` ‚Äî Number of cars passing the site in an hour (target variable)
